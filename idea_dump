# Idea dump

We'll write in here every bit of ideas that come from discussion or thinking during the development process. Infos here should then be formalized in the proper document, eg. story, game mechanic, etc...

- The City, main place of the game, will represent MC. The city will be organic, with flesh walls here and then, a living heart in the middle, pumping and sending flows to the whole city to make it work.
Another place should be the "brain", a big data center.

The City will be full of places that represent a feeling, a memory for MC.

MC's wife and daughter died together, for now without any known cause, and the game will symbolize his fight against depression through that City.

The City will be filled with silhouettes, representing people that MC could come accross, some known faces but not important people for him, at the start of the storyline, the silhouettes will be colorful and might even in some case have a face. The deeper he'll fall into depression, the less visible and colorful the silhouettes will be, to finally come to a translucid greyish shape, or even dissapear.

Depression will be represented by Corruption. Those are created from MC's daughter presence in the City, but this fact won't be obvious until later in the storyline. Corruption doesn't have a representation right now, but it will invade places, and attack the player if he tries to defend it. In corrupted places, silhouettes will attack MC's daughter.

We aim to make the player like MC's daughter, as she will be the center of a lot of morale choices, she'll be narrating during the game, and will have an impact on the player's gameplay, bonuses, etc... In order to put her as someone special, not just a companion following MC.

Occasionnaly, MC's daughter might glitch into MC's wife, no more infos for now.

We decided so far on 3 endings, taking place at the Heart of the city, corruption will eventually get to this place, and being able for it to control the heart would be giving Corruption power on all the City.

  - First choice : Giving MC's daughter to stop the corruption. It would destroy any trace of corruption, but also make MC's daughter dissapear, representing the fact that he'd get 'over' the loss. Some part of the city might be destroyed, or not accessible to the player.
  - Second choice : Destroying the City. Symbolizing suicid, the game would end on MC & MC's daughter walking out of the City under fire, also showing other cities in the landscape. The symbol here would be that MC killed himself, but dying happy, hopying to find his daughter and wife in the afterlife.
  - Last choice : Letting corruption take the heart. That would also be a suicid, but not a chosen one. Corruption/Depression took over every MC had, and the last image would be him, alone, in front of the destroyed city. Another city closeby to his would also be destroyed, representing his daughter city, that he might have seen when getting to the data center.
  
Obviously, the main morale choice in the game will be this one, but the player should have a different experience during two playthrough, depending on his choices, his decisiosn, he'll discover parts of the story that will shape his mind differently.

We've been discussing with Viath about the actual "IRL" part, and didn't agree in either showing some parts of MC real life, or staying in the "city universe".
