### Black Widow
#### Story/Motivation
Black Widow, formerly known as Edward '' Hawkins, was a low-profile britanic slave trader pirate.
Avoiding the usual 'slay and take', he went for a more diplomatic style, spying, paying off, or blackmailing to accomplish his goals, he built a wealthy empire in slave trading between the Caribbean (#todo : change name) and England (#todo : change name). His lack of skill with weapons was easily replaced by his persuasive mind, and the lack of human feeling that caracterized him.
During his wedding ceremony that took place on his very own ship, celebrating the only weakness he would show : his love for Ana, a Caribean slave he once bought, the whole ship began to sink. The whole hull was cracked, letting watter get to the lower part of the ship in a flash, leaving the crew only minutes to find an escape.
Throwing the raft on the sea, he jumped with two of his men outside of the ship, but he wasn't able to find Ana before doing so. She simply vanished, along with some of his mates.

Deriving on the little wooden raft, Edward could only watch the ship sinking right in front of him, powerless. Legend says that the last sound he heard was a Ana's scream.

Rabid, Edward killed what was left of his crew, and threw the two bodies in the sea, left alone in the middle of the sea, with for only companion a bottle of rum.
After hours under the sun, drinking liquor, famished, Edward went crazy, and began speculating that Davy Jones was the causes. Why would his reliable crew do such a thing ? He could offer more money than anyone, he was actually a fairly liked captain. 
Davy Jones, it had to be him. Determined to get Ana back, his only thought was to kill the Devil himself, no matter what he would loose in the process.


tl;dr : After the death of his wife in a ship sabotage, during the wedding ceremony, Black Widow ended up in the sea, alone, blaming Davy Jones for his lost.
